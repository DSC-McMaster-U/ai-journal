# Open-Source Project Template


:wave: Welcome to the Open-Source Team! This repository will serve as an example repo for how our projects should be structured and managed through GitHub. Our goal is to maintain a high development standard and follow the popular open-source project structures and standards we see in our favourite apps and tools.

## :compass: Repo Navigation
**.github:** This folder contains Github's automatically supported community health files. It allows us to generate templates for issues and pull requests, as well as define GitHub Actions. In this particular folder, we included the following:
- **ISSUE_TEMPLATE:** a folder containing issue templates
- **pull_request_template.md:** a pull request template
- **workflows:** a folder containing a simple sample Github Actions workflow that you can modify to have automated testing and deployment.

**PLAN-TEMPLATE.MD:** This is the planning & documentation template that each lead will be responsible for completing.
