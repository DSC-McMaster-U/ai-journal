<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## üö® Join This Team!

GDSC Open Source is a wonderful opportunity to gain real experience working with other developers in an agile-like environment. My goal with this project and team is to provide applicable experience for your future co-ops and software positions. [AutoML](https://github.com/DSC-McMaster-U/Auto-ML) was the most mentioned piece on my resume during interviews, allowing me to discuss higher-level topics in more detail and to talk about DevOps, cloud, and AI comfortably. I hope to give everyone on this team the same experience.

This project will focus on delivering a **complete product** that other developers and recruiters can see, with **extensive documentation, diagrams, and photos**. There will also be a focus on **DevOps and cloud infrastructure**.

If you are interested in learning more in these areas, consider applying to my team! I am looking for dedicated individuals who are able to learn things as they go. You don't have to know any of the tools listed below (although it would be a plus), as I didn't know them before. Just show up consistently!

## üìã About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Journaling is a highly beneficial practice with numerous advantages for mental health, mood improvement, and academic performance.

- For mental health, journaling serves as a therapeutic outlet, allowing individuals to express their thoughts and emotions, thereby reducing stress and anxiety. It helps in organizing thoughts, which can lead to better problem-solving and clearer thinking.
- Journaling has been shown to enhance mood by fostering self-reflection and gratitude, leading to a more positive outlook on life.
- Academically, students who journal regularly often experience improved grades as the practice enhances critical thinking skills, helps with memory retention, and promotes a structured approach to learning.

It also doesn't matter what you journal about, as numerous studies find that people experience improvements in their life regardless of their approach. As such, the most important thing is to reduce friction between you and the habit of writing. This application aims to make it as easy, satisfying, and comfortable as possible to make journaling a daily habit.
